This tool offers an interactive way to visualize the three sorting algorithms:
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Cocktail Sort

Users are able to see, and compare how each method performs when the given list:
- is randomly generated
- is sorted in reverse
- is mostly sorted
- has very few unique items
